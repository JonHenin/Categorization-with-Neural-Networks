## CATEGORIZING USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND KERAS

## Project Description
This project takes reddit comments and categorizes them into groups of News, Science & Technology, Sports and Video Games.  Using One-?Hot Encoding for the categories and vectorizing the comments, models are built using sklearn Neural Network and Keras to compare scores.

Unfortunately the dataset is too large to upload here in full but will be providing a small sample subset.
